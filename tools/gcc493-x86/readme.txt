We only need make.exe and echo.exe from gcc493-x86/bin folder to build AlteraPlatformPkg on Windows
ARM Cross Compiler used by AlteraPlatformPkg is actually from SoCEDS DS-5 sub-folder
make.exe and echo.exe is extracted from EDK2 Developer Tools for Windows project on 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/edk2developertoolsforwindows/
